# Lunar Landing

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym.
It consists of the following components:

    Network: A neural network model for approximating the Q-function.
    ReplayMemory: A replay memory for storing and sampling experiences.
    Agent: The reinforcement learning agent implementing the DQN algorithm.
